# N-Queens-Problem

I hope we all are familiar with **N - Queens Problem** in chess. It is one of the famous problems related to optimal solution search. I have solved this problem using **Genetic Algorithm** as a *Heuristic Search*.

#### What is N - Queens Problem?

Given a chess board of size (N x N) (generally it's 8 x 8, but we can take any size) we have to place the n queens (or 8 queens) on the board such that no queen attacks other queens. *Quite an interesting problem!* I have solved this using **Genetic Algorithm**. You may or may not get the best solution from this code as it depends on **mutation** and **crossover pairs** that are considered by the algorithm itself. But I optimized it such that most of the times you will get the solution. Please go through the code I uploaded. If anyone wants to know more about **Genetic Algorithm** or any other *Machine-Learning* and *Artifical-Intelligence* related stuff, please go through this site and read the articles.
